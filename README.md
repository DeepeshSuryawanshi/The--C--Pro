🚀 **C & C++ Learning Repository**

Welcome to my C & C++ Learning Repository! 🎯 This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey as I learn C and C++, exploring fundamental concepts, data structures, algorithms, and best practices.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here
- 📂 **Basic Programs** – Hello World, Input/Output, Data Types, Operators
- 🔄 **Control Flow** – Loops, Conditionals, Functions
- 🗂 **Data Structures** – Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- 🚀 **Advanced Topics** – Pointers, Memory Management, OOP (for C++), File Handling
- 📝 **Practice Problems** – Solutions to coding challenges and exercises
- 📚 **Project-Based Learning** – Mini-projects to apply concepts in real-world scenarios

## 🔧 Requirements
- A C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- An IDE or text editor (VS Code, CodeBlocks, CLion, etc.)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## 🛠 How to Run
Clone this repository:
```bash

cd The-Cpp-Pro
```
Compile and run a program:
For C:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
```
For C++:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
```
